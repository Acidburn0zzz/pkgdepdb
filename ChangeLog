2013-07-28 Blub

	* -Rstrict:
		Database has a strict flag now.  Will later be used to  change
		how to treat osabi values set to 0.A
	* 'josn' config typo fixed:
		In the config file, 'json' was not recognized, as there was  a
		typo making it 'josn', for now both will  be  recognized,  but
		the typo is deprecated (for obvious reasons...)

	* -Rpkg-ld-append, --ld-append:
		Fixed bug: append inserted before the last element...   *sigh*

2013-07-09 Blub (0.1.2)

	* Released

2013-07-09 Blub

	* database format change:
		Added a bitfield to mask rules and library paths from being to
		the database.  Writing a database with no  rule  entries  will
		cause version 1 to be used.
	* configuration file:
		will now look  for  config  files  ~/.pkgdepdb/config  or  for
		pkgdepdb.conf in $(SYSCONFDIR)
	* package dependency tracking:
		Now also reading depend= and optdepend= entries from  .PKGINFO
		files.  Databases with package-dependency info  will  use  the
		database format version 3 as it modifies the way packages  are
		serialized.
		Dependency tracking can be enabled or disabled in  the  config
		or via the --depends commandline switch.
	* base package list:
		A list of base packages can be created which contains  a  list
		of packages which will be  assumed  installed  during  package
		aware dependency checks.
	* json option:
		--json or -J now take a parameter specifying where json format
		is supposed to be used.

	* queries/json:
		json formatted output for all queries for the sake of
		machine readability.
	* options: -q to raise the LogLevel to Print
	* database version 2:
		contains per-package library paths and a list of files
		which are to be ignored at link-time.
	* rules:
		-R / --rule takes a rule command to modify rules like
		file-ignores or package library paths.
	* path strings:
		path strings in rules or --ld parameters now get sanitized

2013-07-07 Blub

	* db.cpp: -L shows rpath and runpath with a single -v now
	* elf.cpp: pathlists are now handled differently, prevous
	           path fixes may have broken rpath/runpath entries
	           so please rebuild your databases...
	* more: added a filter for -P to show only broken packages:
	        --broken. Verbosity levels affect the output.
