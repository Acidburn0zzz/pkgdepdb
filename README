                               pkgdepdb
v0.1.5

Description:

    This tool is helpful to  find  library  dependencies  of  packages
    without unpacking or installing them to a temporary location.   It
    reads through the archive file, optionally parses a .PKGINFO  file
    if one  is  encountered,  and  then  prints  a  list  of  required
    libraries of each ELF file contained in the library.

    Additionally it can manage a dependency database.  In this mode it
    performs a  virtual  installation  of  a  package's  binaries  and
    libraries into a database, in which only the dependency  lists  is
    maintained.

    Read the manpage for more information, including usage examples.

Installation:

    Dependencies:

        built time:
            a C++11 compatible compiler
            libarchive
            BSD or GNU compatible `make'
        runtime:
            libarchive

    Installation:

        run `make' to compile the program
        run `make install' to install the program and documentation

        Don't forget to set a PREFIX and DESTDIR.

        Typical packaging scripts (such as an Arch PKGBUILD)
        will want to use:

            $ make
            $ make PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=$pkgdir install

    install-variables:

        PREFIX
            Default: /usr/local
            The prefix used for installation. This works just like
            the --prefix option in ./configure would.

        DESTDIR
            Default: empty
            Target destination prefix. Usually used by packaging
            scripts.

        BINDIR
            Default: $(PREFIX)/bin
            Binary files will be installed to this location.
            Files:
                pkgdepdb

        DATADIR
            Default: $(PREFIX)/share
            Currently nothing ends up here, but MANDIR uses this path.

        MANDIR
            Default: $(DATADIR)/man
            Location where manpages end up.

        MAN1DIR
            Default: $(MANDIR)/man1
            Section 1 manpage directory.
            Files:
                pkgdepdb.1

        SYSCONFDIR
            Default: $(PREFIX)/etc
            Location which will be searched for `pkgdepdb.conf`.

    Deinstallation:

        There exists an `uninstall' make-target, however you  have  to
        specifcy the same PREFIX and  DESTDIR  variables  as  you  did
        while installing the package in order to  remove  the  correct
        files.
