.Sh DESCRIPTION
This tool is helpful to find library dependencies of packages without
unpacking or installing them to a temporary location. It reads through
the archive file, optionally parses a .PKGINFO file one is
encountered, and then prints a list of required libraries of each ELF
file contained in the library.
.Pp
Additionally it can manage a dependency database. In this mode it
performs a virtual installation of a package's binaries and libraries
into a database, in which only the dependency lists is maintained.
