	* db.cpp: -L shows rpath and runpath with a single -v now
	* elf.cpp: pathlists are now handled differently, prevous
	           path fixes may have broken rpath/runpath entries
	           so please rebuild your databases...
	* more: added a filter for -P to show only broken packages:
	        --broken. Verbosity levels affect the output.
